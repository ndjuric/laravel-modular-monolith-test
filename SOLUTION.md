### Solution
In the `create_events_table` migration, I commented out the `available_tickets` field to follow the README's directive for it to be a calculated property. This oversight, due to focusing on Laravel 10 and Modules documentation, caused a brief delay.

I identified a concurrency issue where simultaneous ticket purchases could oversell because `available_tickets` wasnâ€™t updated transactionally. To resolve this, I ensured that `available_tickets` dynamically reflects the venue's capacity minus tickets sold and implemented MySQL transactions (`PaymentController.php`).
